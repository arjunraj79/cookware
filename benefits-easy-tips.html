            <h2>Easy Tips for Better Cooking</h2>

            <p>
                Before using your ONS pressure cooker to prepare meals, read this section after completing the "Trial Run Before Cooking."
            </p>

            <h4>Size</h4>
            <p>
                Cooking time is determined by the size of each food item, not the total quantity.  
                For even cooking, chop ingredients into uniform pieces.
            </p>

            <h4>Combining Foods</h4>
            <p>
                Foods requiring similar cooking times may be cooked together if kept physically separate, so flavors do not mix.  
                Foods with different cooking times can be cooked together using these techniques:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Shorten cooking time by cutting foods into smaller pieces and soaking beans, lentils, and grains beforehand.</li>
                <li>Lengthen cooking time by cutting foods into larger pieces and wrapping them in foil.</li>
                <li>Start cooking ingredients requiring more time, then pause the cooker, add quick-cooking items, and resume pressure cooking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Adapting Your Own Recipes</h4>
            <p>
                Most moist-heat recipes (steaming, boiling, stews, braises) adapt well to pressure cooking.  
                Refer to similar ONS recipes to estimate water quantities, food proportions, and cooking times.
            </p>
            <p>
                If no similar recipe exists, cook under pressure for one-third of the usual time, check doneness, then continue cooking if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reduce liquid amounts because pressure cooking limits evaporation—ensure there is always enough liquid for the entire cooking duration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pressure cooking intensifies flavor, so season lightly and adjust after cooking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Milk, cream, and yogurt may curdle when cooked under pressure; add them after pressure cooking unless recipe specifies otherwise.
            </p>

            <h4>Heat Source</h4>
            <p>
                ONS pressure cookers work on kerosene, gas, electric hot plates, and induction (for compatible models such as Stainless Steel and TRI-PLY).
            </p>
            <p>
                Ensure the burner size matches the cooker base. Gas flames should not rise up the sides.
            </p>
            <p>
                On wood or coal fires, keep the cooker at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) above direct coals.  
                Do not expose the cooker to excessive heat as found on industrial burners (except Big PEXA models).
            </p>
            <p>
                For legumes and foods that may sprout, cook on medium heat until full pressure is reached; then reduce the heat.  
                If steam escapes forcefully, briefly remove the cooker from heat.
            </p>

            <h4>Frying Prior to Pressure Cooking</h4>
            <p>
                Some recipes require light frying before adding liquids.  
                You may fry or brown ingredients in a small amount of fat directly in the cooker body without the lid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Browning meat enhances flavor and seals in juices, but it is optional.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brown food in small batches to maintain high oil temperature and ensure proper searing.
            </p>
            <p>
                After frying, remove the cooker from heat before adding liquid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not deep-fry in aluminum or anodized aluminum cookers (i.e., more than ½ cup oil or for more than 20 minutes).  
                Stainless Steel & TRI-PLY ONS cookers allow longer deep-frying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pressure frying is never recommended—it requires oil-only cooking, and pressure cookers are designed for steam-based cooking.
            </p>

            <h4>Water</h4>
            <p>
                The pressure cooker must contain enough water (or other liquids such as stock, juices, vinegar, wine, or beer) to generate steam.  
                Oils and fats do not produce steam.
            </p>
            <p>
                Insufficient water may lead to burnt food, a blown safety valve, or cooker damage.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Minimum liquid requirement:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For the first 10 minutes: 1 cup of liquid</li>
                <li>For each additional 10 minutes: ½ cup more (or proportional amount)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Reduce heat once full pressure is achieved to prevent boiling dry.  
                Never use the pressure cooker as an oven for dry heating or baking.
            </p>

            <h4>Timing</h4>
            <p>
                Start timing only after the cooker reaches full pressure.  
                Use a clock or timer—whistle counting is inaccurate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because pressure cooking is fast, timing mistakes may lead to undercooked or overcooked food.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the food is slightly undercooked, you may finish cooking without pressure.  
                For foods sensitive to overcooking, resume pressure cooking for a few more minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recipes provide approximate times. Adjust based on food age, softness, and preference.
            </p>
            <p>
                A recipe specifying "Pressure Cooking Time 0 minute" means:  
                <em>Turn off the heat as soon as full pressure is reached.</em>
            </p>

            <h4>Reducing Heat</h4>
            <p>
                Cooking on high heat after reaching full pressure does not cook food faster.  
                It wastes fuel, increases risk of burning, and may damage the cooker.
            </p>
            <p>
                On campfires or wood stoves, move the cooker to a cooler spot or adjust heat to maintain gentle steaming.
            </p>

            <h4>Releasing Pressure</h4>
            <p>
                There are three methods to release pressure:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Allow to cool naturally:</strong>  
                    Turn off heat and let pressure drop on its own (10–20 minutes).  
                    Required for soups, dals, leavened dishes, and custards.  
                    Often improves flavor and tenderness (especially meats).
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Instant release by lifting pressure regulator slightly:</strong>  
                    Use a fork to lift the regulator just enough to release steam.  
                    Best for fish and delicate vegetables.  
                    <em>Not suitable for liquid-heavy recipes (risk of liquid escaping).</em>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Cold water release:</strong>  
                    Place cooker in 4 inches (10 cm) of cold water.  
                    Open lid once pressure drops.  
                    Do not splash water onto the lid.  
                    Used when cooker has liquid or foaming foods that require immediate opening.  
                    <em>Not recommended for 3L/5L Stainless Steel, TRI-PLY, or Induction Disc Base models.</em>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Switching release methods changes cooking time:  
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Instant → natural cooling: <strong>reduce</strong> cooking time by 2–3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Natural → instant opening: <strong>increase</strong> cooking time by 2–3 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
