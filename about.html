            <h2>About The Company</h2>
            <p>ONS Cookers has been operating since 1985. There are currently THREE offices, TWO WAREHOUSES, ONE factory, and around 100 employees. It is the DIRECTOR of the Indian pressure cooker market and has been exporting to nations on all six continents since 2020. Over 15 million cookware and pressure cookers have been sold by ONS globally. All ONS pressure cookers are listed by Underwriters Laboratories, an independent global agency that tests items for public safety. The Government of India has made it essential, beginning February 1, 2021, to register all Pressure Cookers manufactured and marketed in India with the Bureau of Indian Standards, often known as ISI. As a result, every pressure cooker we produce has both the ISI stamp and BIS certification.</p>
            <p>A lid that fits within is a characteristic of every ONS pressure cooker. Compared to traditional pressure cookers, this design is by nature safer. In order to open any ONS cooker, you must first lower the lid a little bit into the cooker's body. This cannot be done until the steam pressure within the cooker drops to a safe level. Like an aircraft door, ONS pressure cookers are therefore pressure-locked for safety!</p>
            <p>The ONS Company is renowned for consistently innovating its products and for never sacrificing quality. The ONS pressure cookers that millions of families use are the result of the most rigorous quality control, the best production techniques, the most careful material selection, and the most extensive research and development.</p>
            <p>Each cooker undergoes leak-proof testing. This, in conjunction with an excellent pressure- regulating mechanism, guarantees that ONS cooks the fastest. Individually packaged in a visually appealing full-color carton is each pressure cooker. Free instruction manuals and cookbooks are included with every pressure cooker. Every ONS pressure cooker is covered by a five-year warranty ON THE DATE OF PURCHASE. DON'T FORGET THE GST BILL FROM RETAILERS OR WHOLESELLERS.</p>
