                    <p>An Indian businessman named Shri Bhagwan Das Gupta founded ONS Cookers in 1985 while working in marketing alongside his wife, Shri Shanti Devi Gupta. He was raised by a father with limited resources but unwavering, devout beliefs. He achieved prosperity early in life, but the partition of India changed his life forever. At the age of 47, he established ONS firm in 1984 with a capital of Rs. 10,000, having to start again in midlife. This firm is based on HIS YOUNGER SON Mr. Rajesh Kumar Gupta's selection of products, people, and values, the most essential of which are integrity, hard work, and customer satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>Shri Bhagwan Das Gupta passed away in 2003.</p>

                    <p>In addition to his extensive experience and knowledge in management, marketing, and advertising, the company benefited greatly from his knowledge of the cookware and pressure cooker industries.
