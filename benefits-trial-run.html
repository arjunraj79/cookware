            <h2>Trial Run Before Cooking</h2>

            <p>
                Do a test run before using your ONS, even if you have experience with pressure cookers.  
                This section will walk you through the complete trial run, which takes approximately 30 minutes.
            </p>

            <h4>Preliminary Steps</h4>
            <p>
                Wash the cooker after removing the label, using vegetable or baby oil to remove any glue.  
                Read "Almanac of Pressure Cooker," "Important Safeguards," "Parts of an ONS Pressure Cooker," and 
                "Basic Product Information."  
                Note how each component fits together.  
                Remove the pressure regulator, check the sealing ring sits correctly in the lid curl, and practice opening and closing the cooker several times.
            </p>

            <h4>Placing Cooker on Stove</h4>

            <img src="/assets/img/how-to-use/13.jpeg" alt="Placing Cooker on Stove" class="trial-img">

            <p>
                Fill the cooker body with two cups of water.  
                Add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of lemon juice or vinegar (not for anodized cookers) to prevent discoloration.  
                Remove the pressure regulator and ensure the steam vent is clear by looking through it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adjust the sealing ring in the lid curl by pressing it firmly into place.  
                Close the cooker and place it on high heat.
            </p>

            <h4>Ensuring a Steam-tight Seal</h4>
            <p>
                When water begins to boil, steam should emerge ONLY from the steam vent.  
                If steam escapes from the lid edges, adjust the lid by sliding it slightly toward the escape point and locking it again.  
                The lid will be hot—DO NOT touch with bare hands.
            </p>

                <div class="trial-image-block">
                    <img src="/assets/img/how-to-use/14.jpeg" alt="Wrong: Steam Leakage" class="trial-img">
                    <p class="caption">WRONG: Steam coming out from lid edge</p>
                </div>

                <div class="trial-image-block">

                </div>
            </div>

            <h4>Placing the Pressure Regulator</h4>

            <img src="/assets/img/how-to-use/16.jpeg" alt="Placing Pressure Regulator" class="trial-img">
            <img src="/assets/img/how-to-use/17.jpeg" alt="Placing Pressure Regulator Step 2" class="trial-img">

            <p>
                Once a steady flow of steam is coming from the vent, press the pressure regulator firmly downward onto the steam vent.  
                Keep fingers away from the escaping steam—only touch the top of the regulator.
            </p>
            <p>
                A soft "click" sound indicates that the regulator is properly seated.  
                The cooker will reach full operating pressure in about two minutes.
            </p>

            <h4>How to Recognize Full Operating Pressure</h4>

            <p>
                When the regulator is placed, you will first hear a faint hissing sound.  
                Once steam increases to maximum level, the regulator will begin to whistle.  
                This indicates the cooker has reached full operating pressure.  
                Reduce the heat and begin timing your recipe.
            </p>

            <p><strong>THE ONS COOKER WHISTLES AT FULL OPERATING PRESSURE</strong></p>

            <h4>Maintaining Pressure on Reduced Heat</h4>
            <p>
                After full pressure is reached, reduce heat from HIGH to MEDIUM or lower.  
                The cooker will maintain approximately 15 psi (1 kg/cm²).
            </p>
            <p>
                If the cooker whistles more than four times per minute, reduce heat further.  
                If no steam escapes for several minutes, increase heat slightly.  
                Electric stoves may require small adjustments.
            </p>

            <h4>Releasing Pressure</h4>
            <p>
                Turn off the heat and remove the cooker from the burner.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>ONS:</strong> Use a fork to gently lift the pressure regulator slightly to release steam.  
                Do NOT remove the pressure regulator entirely.
            </p>

            <img src="/assets/img/how-to-use/19.jpeg" alt="Releasing Pressure" class="trial-img">

            <p>
                Release pressure as required by the recipe or follow the guidelines in  
                <a href="/benefits-easy-tips.html">Easy Tips for Better Cooking</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>Final Steps</h4>
            <p>
                Once pressure has fully released, open the cooker.  
                Discard the water, rinse the pressure regulator, lid, and cooker body, and dry thoroughly.  
                Store the cooker with the lid open to prevent odor buildup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before attempting real cooking, read the detailed instruction manual or cookbook included with your ONS Pressure Cooker.
