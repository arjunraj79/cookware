            <h2>Care & Cleaning</h2>

            <p>Follow these instructions to get the most out of your ONS Pressure Cooker.</p>

            <h4>Body and Lid</h4>
            <p>
                Prior to use, take off the label, clean, rinse, and dry the cooker. Use vegetable or baby oil to remove any glue.  
                Never strike the cooker body's rim with a ladle, spoon, or other objects. Ensure that the lid's edge is free of dents that
                could affect sealing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Never leave food or water inside the cooker for extended periods. Keep the cooker away from dirty dishes and water.
                Decomposing food and chemicals in water can cause pitting. Do not leave lemon juice, vinegar, mayonnaise, mustard,
                or salty liquids in the cooker. Never add salt without liquid inside.
            </p>

            <h4>Handles</h4>
            <p>
                Plastic handles may shatter if struck.  
                The "play" or movement in the lid handle bar is intentional—do not attempt to remove or tighten it.
            </p>

            <h4>Rubber Sealing Ring / Gasket</h4>
            <p>
                The sealing ring may deform if stretched, especially when hot.  
                Replace it when it cracks, hardens, or stops sealing.  
                Before replacing, ensure the lid is correctly positioned and the ring is properly seated in the lid curl.  
                Sometimes rotating or inverting the ring will stop a leak.
            </p>

            <h4>General Cleaning</h4>
            <p>
                The pressure cooker and its parts must never be washed in a dishwasher.  
                (ONS Pexa and Mexa bodies may be washed in a dishwasher but may tarnish.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Always clean and dry all surfaces immediately after use.  
                Leaving food on the metal can cause corrosion. Wash all parts with hot water and mild soap. Rinse and dry thoroughly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remove the sealing ring when cleaning the lid. Wash gently without stretching it.  
                Ensure the steam vent is clear—insert a thin wire if needed and rinse thoroughly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clean the perforations inside the pressure regulator using a water jet.  
                The black spring may lose color over time; this does not affect performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clean the area between the lid and lid handle bar with a brush as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hard anodized cooker bases may develop metallic marks from stove supports.  
                Remove them using kitchen cleaner with an abrasive scrubber like Scotch-Brite or fine steel wool.
            </p>

            <h4>Baked-on Stains</h4>
            <p>
                If food or oil residue remains on the cooker and is reheated, it may become "baked-on" and difficult to remove.  
                Clean the cooker base before placing it on a hot stove. Ensure the burner surface is free of fat drippings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soak the base in hot water. Apply a chlorine-based kitchen cleaner and let it sit for 5–10 minutes.  
                Scrub using steel wool in circular motions. Rinse and dry.
            </p>
            <p>
                For burnt food:  
                Add enough water (not more than half full) to cover the stuck food.  
                Close the lid and bring to full pressure. Cook 5 minutes on low heat.  
                Allow natural cooling, then clean normally.  
                Avoid bleach and harsh abrasive powders.
            </p>

            <h4>Loss of Shine</h4>
            <p>
                With frequent use, the aluminum body and lid may lose shine. This is natural and harmless.
            </p>

            <h4>Removing Stains Caused by Chemicals in Water</h4>
            <p>
                (Not applicable to TRI-PLY, Stainless Steel, or Hard Anodized Mexa & PEXA models.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Mineral-rich water may darken the inside of the cooker.  
                This does not affect food quality or safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                To remove stains:  
                Fill the cooker halfway with water.  
                Add two tablespoons of lemon juice or tartaric acid per liter.  
                Cook on high heat for 15 minutes with full pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
                For stains on the upper part of the cooker body, simmer the same solution (without pressure) for 30 minutes.  
                Wash and dry thoroughly.
            </p>

            <h4>Storing</h4>
            <p>
                Allow all parts to dry completely before storage.  
                Keep the sealing ring in the lid curl and store the cooker open to prevent mustiness.
            </p>

            <h4>How to Prevent Unnecessary Fusing of the Safety Valve</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure the steam vent is clear.</li>
                <li>Do not fill the cooker more than two-thirds (or half for liquids).</li>
                <li>Add adequate water for the cooking duration.</li>
                <li>Do not use the cooker on industrial burners (except Big PEXA models).</li>
                <li>Reduce heat once "Full Operating Pressure" is reached.</li>
                <li>Remove the cooker from heat after cooking time is completed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Replaceable Parts</h4>
            <p>
                For safety and durability, always use original ONS spare parts.
